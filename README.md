Webclient for Pok√©mon Online
============================

It connects to a relay station, which in turns connects to a PO server. If
you want multiple webclients to be able to connect to your server through
a relay station, you'd better add the relay station to the proxy servers
in your server config.

The host of the official PO relay station is ws://server.pokemon-online.eu:10508

Cloning
=======

This contains a submodule, so don't forget to do the following commands after the initial clone:
```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

When merging a commit, if their ps/ folder has changed head, you need to do the following command in order to update the submodule folder in your local directory:
```sh
git submodule update
```

Webclient for Pok√©mon Online

It connects to a relay station, which in turns connects to a PO server. If
you want multiple webclients to be able to connect to your server through
a relay station, you'd better add the relay station to the proxy servers 
in your server config.

The host of the official PO relay station is ws://server.pokemon-online.eu:10508
